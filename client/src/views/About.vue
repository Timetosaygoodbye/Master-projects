    <h2 class="mb-5">Some background stories</h2>
    <br />

    <p class="mb-5">
      We are a group of four web developers(Siyu Zhuang, Tiancheng Lu, Chi Song
      and Ziyuan Xu)When we first discussed the topic for our final project, we
      actually had no clues for what to choose. Then we realized that we four
      are all gamers, why don't we choose the topic we most interested in? We
      are all Overwatch players and we all love the game very much. Maybe some
      of you never heard or played this game before, frankly overwatch is not
      that popular as League of Legends, DOTA2 or CS: GO. But we still have an
      active which support the game. Beside the game itself, there is a
      professional Esport league based on overwatch-the Overwatch League (OWL).
      2020 has been the third year for this grand Esport tournament. One
      particular advantage of eSport compared to traditional sports is that
      every movement in the games is recorded. Moreover, the Overwatch League
      provides an official API interface, which has almost all the critical
      information related to OWL. That is why we made this information display
      website.

    <h2 class="mb-5">Something about our design</h2>

    <p class="mb-5">
      We use Vue as our front-end framework, which is a little bit different
      form the Bootstrap we learned from the class. For the style sheet, we used
      Bootstrap-Vue correspondingly. As for back-end framework, we chose
      express.js. And finally, for database we chose MongoDB.
